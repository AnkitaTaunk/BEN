Objectives::
1. Evaluate the response time of critical functionalities under load conditions.


Tools::
JMeter: It is widely known open source software for performance testing, load testing, and stress testing of web applications, APIs, and cloud services. It provides a user-friendly interface, supports various protocols, and offers extensive reporting capabilities in a graphical report.


Test Cases::
a. Registration: 
Create a test suite to register users concurrently to check the ability of the system to handle new user sign-ups during peak load.
b. Login:
Simulate concurrent user logins to assess the response time and throughput of the login process under heavy load.
c. Password setting and resetting :
Simulate concurrent password setting and a few reseting requests to measure the system's performance in processing password related operations during peak usage.
Metrics:

Metrics :: 
Response Time: Measure the time taken for each user action (registration, login, password reset).
Throughput: Calculate the number of successful user actions processed per second.
Error Rate: Monitor the percentage of failed requests or errors encountered during the test.
CPU and Memory Usage: Track the server's CPU and memory utilization during the test to identify resource constraints.
Test Environment:

Server Configuration: Deploy the cloud service on a scalable infrastructure with sufficient CPU, memory, and network resources to support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
Network Settings: Configure the network to simulate real-world conditions, including latency and bandwidth constraints.
Load Generators: Distribute load generators across multiple machines to generate realistic traffic and distribute the load effectively.

Analysis::
Analyze the collected performance metrics using JMeter's built-in reporting tools and plugins.
Identify any performance bottlenecks, such as high response times or error rates, and investigate the root causes.
Generate comprehensive performance reports and share findings with stakeholders.
Use performance profiling tools to analyze server-side performance and optimize critical components if necessary.
