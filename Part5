Scenario 1 :: 

Response:
My personal favourite is assigning a reviewer for every tasks which is reviewed by another fellow developer so they can check these problems before it's been published and also learn from it for the future. 

And in order to tackle this issue effectively, it is crucial to implement a systematic approach aimed at identifying the underlying cause of the surge in bugs and implementing a better solutions to address them. Here's my proposed strategy

Break down complex tasks into manageable steps and focus on automation testing and other tests.

Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members by pairing testers with developers or experienced automation engineers.

Review the specifications and requirements for the new features to ensure they were clearly defined and understood by the development team.

Analyze the bug reports to categorize and prioritize them based on severity and impact on user experience.


Senario 2 :: 

Response:

Provide comprehensive training sessions on automated testing tools and frameworks for team members who are new to automation.

Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members by pairing testers with developers or experienced automation engineers.

Foster a culture of teamwork and mentorship where team members can learn from each other and leverage collective expertise.

Recognize the efforts and achievements of team members who actively participate in the transition to automated testing.

Reward individuals who contribute innovative ideas, overcome obstacles, or demonstrate significant improvement in automation skills.
